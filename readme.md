# Simple One-File Metronome

Made this to help a friend with studying. Started with AI-generated stuff,
tweaked from there. Plain HTML/CSS/JS. No dependencies. Load in browser
and run it, job done.

Not in any way meant to be a "perfect" use of JS or anything like that.
It's literally a quick hacktastic janky little thing to enable somebody
to study and memorize things more effectively.


## I am not an audio engineer or musician.

I have no idea if these BPM values are "right" or not. All this thing does
is keep some kind of beat. These BPM values may or may not reflect what real
musicians use, so by all means, if you are one and know better, **PLEASE** submit
a pull request! I can't even read music (at this stage of life - and I doubt it'll
change) so insert that "I have no idea what I'm doing" meme right up in here.
